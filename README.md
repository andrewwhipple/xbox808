Xbox808

A ChucK script that turns an XBOX controller into an 808 drum machine.

To use:
1) Change file paths in assignment to sounds[], replacing the "/../" with the full file paths
2) Plug in your joystick
3) Start the script (either in the terminal or in miniaudicle)
4) Change any mappings to suit your fancy (or if your joystick is mapped differently)
5) Play some drums dude.
